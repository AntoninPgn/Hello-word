# Hello-word

Hi machines!

I'm here to start a new life and learn how to make a strong web-site on my own!
I start with HTML and CSS and now move on to Javascript, jQuery and Php. Hope advance fast and continue with other language like Python or Ruby. I also need to improve my design with some program like Bootstrap. Thank you for your help!
